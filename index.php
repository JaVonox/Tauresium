	Hello and welcome to Tauresium! This website is intended to be a playable mapgame hosted online. The contents of this website were created by 100505349 for use in their Application development class
	for the university of derby.

	<b> What is Tauresium? </b>
	<br>
	Tauresium is an online map game inwhich a player takes control of a nation attempting to expand its influence over the modern world. The end goal of this project is to have a game which allows multiple players to
	interact with a world and each other. Each area in the game reflects a real life enviroment - and it is the intention to reflect the people and culture of these regions through in game text and
	gameplay mechanics
	<br><br>
	<b> How do i play?</b>
	<br>
	How to play can be found under the tutorial segment on the top bar on any page!
	<br><br>
	<b> Who is the winner? </b>
	<br>
	While there is no definitive winner of the game - the winner can be said to be the nation who controls the most territory.
	<br><br>
	<b> When will this be done? </b>
	<br>
	I have no idea
